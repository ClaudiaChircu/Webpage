            <h2 style="align" center">Technical Writer. Self-learner. Tech addict.</h2>
              <p>Hi! I'm Clau and I'm passionate about writing and technology. And writing about technology.ðŸ˜„</p>
              <p>I created this webpage to showcase my HTML & CSS knowldge gained while working as a Technical Writer. My main work area consists in delivering a variety of outputs: PDF Guides (Admin User Guides, Quick Reference Guides), Online Help, FAQs, Release Notes, Short Videos. The tools I use to write the documentation are MadCap Flare (HTML & CSS), ServiceNOW (Knowledge Bases), PPT. I also use Camtasia to edit and build short videos that illustrate newly implemented features.</p>
              <p>I am an amateur photographer, passionate about astrophotography and boardgames enthusiast.ðŸ¤©</p>

                <h3>Networking</h3>
                    <p>Networking projects aim to offer efficient, secure and application optimized software-defined network with integrated virtual functions that will be responsive to real-time demands of cloud services and digitization. These projects helped me to have a better understanding of the networking solutions and take my knowledge to the next level, having a hands-on experience using different portals.</p>
         <br />
                <h3>Mobile and Data solution</h3>
                    <p>The Mobile and Data solutions provide companies and employees flexible working options, like bundles and devices. While working as a technical writer on this project, I learned to create and deliver multiple outputs using MadCap Flare, PowerPoint, Camtasia and ServiceNow to ensure the customers have all the necessary information and reduce the number of tickets received by Helpdesk.</p>

          <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
          <p>Outside working hours I enjoy walking in the park with my husband and my sister-in-law while taking photos. After getting some knowledge on photo editing, I started a photography blog where I publish my pics (work-in-progress in terms of content). This way I took my skills to the next level, by completing my SharePoint knowledge with WordPress.</p>
